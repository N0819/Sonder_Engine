    """Care at the MINTING of an edge, to match the care taken merging one.

    The upsert-with-silence doctrine above is scrupulous about not ERASING an
    edge's fields, and that scruple was entirely absent from creating one: a
    previously unseen edge was accepted verbatim, so a model asserting an
    adjacency invented a doorway with no check at all -- measured as
    `r0204 <-> r0303`, a diagonal in a grid maze that is impossible by
    construction, standing in the world model for hundreds of turns and
    walked as a real doorway (docs/UNBUILT.md 1.2). One check is decidable
    everywhere and lands here; a NEW edge is one with no standing declaration
    in either direction, so a re-declaration of a known doorway from its
    other side is untouched.

    RECIPROCITY OF UNSEALING. `_shield_standing_passage` above establishes
    that sealing a passage takes a two-sided declaration. The same holds in
    reverse, through a hole it could not see: with only `B -> A: wall`
    standing, a model minting a fresh `A -> B: open` created passage through
    the wall one-sidedly, because the walks are undirected and cross an edge
    either side declares. So a new PASSABLE edge whose standing reciprocal
    reads `wall` is refused unless the same diff re-declares that reciprocal
    as passable too. Scoped to `wall` exactly as the sealing shield is: a
    standing `closed_door` reciprocal stays one-sidedly openable (opening a
    door is an ordinary act, declared from whichever side the actor stands),
    and a standing `window`/`one_way_window` reciprocal is left to the basis
    work this deliberately does not attempt.

    What this does NOT check, on the record. GEOMETRY: the model has no
    coordinates, so a general scene cannot say what a grid maze could.
    BASIS: whether anything witnessed, walked or authored the doorway --
    that needs a stated basis on the edge itself, a schema-and-prompt change
    across the mapping and spatial specialists. And EXISTENCE of the target
    room: a dangling edge is a tolerated forward reference in this engine
    (`neighbor_map`'s walks tolerate it by design, and the west-wing live
    flow pinned at tests/test_spatial.py's redeclaration test mints the
    corridor's edge before the room), so refusing it would break a real
    mapping flow -- an existence rule has to wait for room-and-edge minting
    to become atomic. Refusing to guess any of the three is why this shield
    is small. Returns a sanitized copy; never mutates the caller's diff.
